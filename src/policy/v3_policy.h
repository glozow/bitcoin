 * Checks the following rules:
 * 1. A v3 tx must only have v3 unconfirmed ancestors.
 * 2. A non-v3 tx must only have non-v3 unconfirmed ancestors.
 * 3. A v3's ancestor set, including itself, must be within V3_ANCESTOR_LIMIT.
 * 4. A v3's descendant set, including itself, must be within V3_DESCENDANT_LIMIT.
 * 5. If a v3 tx has any unconfirmed ancestors, the tx's sigop-adjusted vsize must be within
 * V3_CHILD_MAX_VSIZE.
 *
 *
 * @param[in]   mempool_ancestors       The in-mempool ancestors of ptx, including any that are only
 *                                      direct ancestors of its in-package ancestors.
 * @param[in]   num_in_pkg_ancestors    The number of ancestors not accounted for in ancestors, i.e.
 *                                      in-package parents that have not been submitted to the mempool yet.
 * @param[in]   direct_conflicts        In-mempool transactions this tx conflicts with. These conflicts
 *                                      are used to more accurately calculate the resulting descendant
 *                                      count of in-mempool ancestors.  While V3_ANCESTOR_LIMIT is 2, it
 *                                      is unnecessary to include the conflicts of in-package ancestors
 *                                      because the presence of both in-mempool and in-package ancestors
 *                                      would already be a violation of V3_ANCESTOR_LIMIT.
 * @param[in]   vsize                   The sigop-adjusted virtual size of ptx.
 * @returns an error string if any v3 rule was violated, otherwise std::nullopt.

 * packages in which those calculations may be expensive.

 * package itself. If any checks fail, an error string detailing what failed.
